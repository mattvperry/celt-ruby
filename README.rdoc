== DESCRIPTION:

CELT-Ruby is a Ruby Gem for working with the CELT Audio Codec.
CELT-Ruby uses the Ruby-FFI extension to wrap the native CELT library code.
This means that you must have CELT installed in order for this gem to work.

== FEATURES:

This gem was designed to fill a specific role in another one of my projects.
As a result, the feature set is relatively small compared to the native libraries.
However, I will accept any pull requests with additional functionality should someone need it.

What this library can do:
* Encode raw audio to CELT

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby >= 1.9.2
* CELT 0.7 Library

== INSTALL:

    [sudo] gem install celt-ruby

== USAGE:

    # Create new encoder with a sample rate of 48 kHz, a frame size of 480 bytes and 1 channel
    encoder = Celt::Encoder.new 48000, 480, 1, [60000 / 800, 127].min
    # Set the prediction request to 0
    encoder.prediction_request = 0
    # Set the VBR rate to 60,000
    encoder.vbr_rate = 60000

    # Return the bitstream version for this version of CELT
    encoder.bitstream_version

    # Encode some raw audio
    encoded = encoder.encode raw_audio

    # Safely destroy encoder
    encoder.destroy
